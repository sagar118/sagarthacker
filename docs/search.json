    "text": "2. Learn the basics of Python and it’s packages\nFirst, let’s install Python. The easiest way to do this is by installing Anaconda. All the packages that are required come along with Anaconda.\nYou can start from learning the basics of Python i.e. data structures, functions, class, etc. and it’s libraries. I started learning about python in my college days, I read the book Learn Python the Hard Way. A very good book for beginners. Introduction to Python Programming by Udacity is a free course that covers the basics of Python. Introduction to Python is another free course by Analytics Vidhya. Another free course by Google is Google’s Python Class.\nNext, learn about how to use Regular Expression (also called regex) in Python. It will come in use for data cleaning, especially if you are working with text data. Learn regular expressions through Google class. A very good beginner tutorial for learning regular expression in python on Analytics Vidhya. Cheatsheet for Regex.\nNow comes the fun part of learning the various libraries in Python. Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Sklearn are the packages heavily used in ML.\n\nNumpy provides a high-performance multidimensional array and basic tools to compute with and manipulate these arrays. Numpy quickstart tutorial is a good place to start. This will form a good foundation for this to come. Practice numpy by solving 100 numpy exercises to solve.\nPandas is used for data manipulation and analysis. The most used package in Python is Pandas. Intro to pandas data structure provides a detailed tutorial on pandas. A short course by Kaggle on pandas.\nMatplotlib is a visualization library in python. In the matplotlib tutorial, you will learn the basics of Python data visualization, the anatomy of a Matplotlib plot, and much more. Official documentation of matplotlib is one of the best ways to learn the library.\nSeaborn is another visualization library built on top of matplotlib. Kaggle short course on data visualization provides a good start point to learn the library."

There are various resources to learn ML and I would suggest the following courses:\n\nMachine Learning by Stanford (Coursera) The Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng is one of the best courses out there and covers all the basic algorithms. Also, it introduces all the advanced topics in a very simple manner which is easy to understand. However, this course is taught in Octave rather than the popular languages like R/Python. Also, this course is NOT free but you can apply for financial aid.\nMachine Learning A-Z™: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science (Udemy) Good course for beginners. Explore complex topics such as natural language processing (NLP), reinforcement learning (RL), deep learning (DL) among many others. Tons of practice exercise and quizzes. This course is NOT free but comparatively not expensive.\nMachine Learning (edx) This is an advanced course that has the highest math prerequisite out of any other course in this list. You’ll need a very firm grasp of Linear Algebra, Calculus, Probability, and programming. This course is free of cost but to acquire a certificate payment is required.\nComprehensive learning path for Data Science (Analytics Vidhya) This course covers every topic right from the beginning. Installing Python, data cleaning and preparation, Machine learning concepts, deep learning, and NLP. This course is free and does not come with any certification.\n\nBooks:\n\nThe Hundred Page Machine Learning Book\nThe Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Second Edition\n\nList of best books for machine learning.\nAfter learning about the various techniques in ML the next natural thing to do is apply those techniques. What better place than Kaggle. It is one of the most popular websites among data science enthusiasts. Below two problem statement can be a good starting problem statement to begin with.\n\nTitanic: Machine Learning from Disaster\nHouse Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques"

In this post we have used the PorterStemmer as well.\n\nstemmer = PorterStemmer()\n\ndef stem_words(text):\n    return ' '.join([stemmer.stem(word) for word in text.split()])\n\n\ndf['text_stemmed'] = df.text.apply(lambda text: stem_words(text))\ndf[['text', 'text_stemmed']].head()\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      text\n      text_stemmed\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      username changed\n      usernam chang\n    \n    \n      1\n      unnieeee\n      unnieee\n    \n    \n      2\n      thanks hope youve got good book keep company\n      thank hope youv got good book keep compani\n    \n    \n      3\n      situated\n      situat\n    \n    \n      4\n      youre welcome im glad liked\n      your welcom im glad like\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nPorterStemmer can be used only for english.

    "section": "4. Visualization - Individual Features",
    "text": "4. Visualization - Individual Features\nAfter getting an initial idea about our features and their values, we can now dive into the visual part of the exploration. I recommend to always plot your data. Sometimes this might be challenging, e.g. because you have tons of features. In that case, you want to start at least with a subset before you run any dimensionality reduction or other tools. This step is as much about spotting issues and irregularities as it is about learning more about the shapes and distributions of your features.\n\n4.1. Predictor variables\n\nIn the live session, we were building this plot step by step. (Well, we got most of the way there.) It really pays off to take the time and investigate each feature separately. This is one of the most instructive steps in the EDA process, where you aim to learn how messed up your features are. No dataset is perfect. We want to figure out how severe those imperfections are, and whether we can live with them or have to address them.\nDifferent kind of data types go best with different kind of visuals. My recommendation is to start out with density plots or histograms for numerical features, and with barcharts for those that are better expressed as types of categories.\n\n\n\nCode\nuseful_cols = [col for col in train.columns if col not in [\"id\", \"song_popularity\"]]\nnumeric_cols = [col for col in useful_cols if col not in [\"key\", \"audio_mode\", \"time_signature\"]]\n\nn_rows = 5\nn_cols = 3\nindex = 1\n\ncolors = [\"red\", \"darkblue\", \"green\"]\n\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(16,20))\n\nfor index, col in enumerate(train[useful_cols].columns):\n    plt.subplot(n_rows,n_cols,index+1)\n    \n    if col in numeric_cols:\n        sns.kdeplot(train[col], color=random.sample(colors, 1), fill=True)\n        plt.title(col, fontsize=14)\n        plt.xlabel(\"\")\n        plt.ylabel(\"\")\n        plt.tight_layout()\n    else:\n        sns.countplot(train[col])\n        plt.title(col, fontsize=14)\n        plt.xlabel(\"\")\n        plt.ylabel(\"\")\n        plt.tight_layout()\n\nplt.subplot(n_rows,n_cols,14)\nsns.kdeplot(np.log(train['instrumentalness']), color=random.sample(colors, 1), fill=True)\nplt.title('instrumentalness (log transformed)', fontsize=14)\nplt.ylabel(\" \")\nplt.xlabel(\" \")\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nWe find:\n\nOur initial impressions of the data types have largely been confirmed: audio_mode is a boolean feature, and time_signature and key are ordinal or categorical ones (or integer; although a better understanding of those musical concepts would certainly benefit from some domain knowledge.)\nA number of features are bounded between 0 and 1: accosticness, danceability, energy, liveliness, speechiness, and audio_valence.\nThe feature loudness looks like it refer to the decibel scale.\nThe distribution of instrumentalness is heavily right-skewed, and even after a log transform this feature doesn’t look very well-behaved. This might need a bit more work.\n\n\n\n4.2. Target: Song Popularity\nOn to the target itself. We figured out that song_popularity is a binary feature, and thus we can express it as boolean. Here we plot a barchart.\n\n\nCode\nsns.countplot(train.song_popularity.astype(\"bool\"))\nplt.title(\"Target: Song Popularity\", fontsize=14)\nplt.xlabel(\"\")\nplt.ylabel(\"\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nWe find:\n\nThere is a slight imbalance in the target distribution: a bit more than 60/40. Not super imbalanced, but something to keep in mind."

It’s best to perfom those steps in that order, so that you can understand and interpret the interactions in the context of the overall distributions.\n\n5.1. Target impact\nWe have seen all the feature distributions, now we want to investigate whether they look different based on the target value. Here’s an example for song_duration:\n\n\nCode\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(16,18))\nn_rows = 4\nn_cols = 3\n\nfor index, col in enumerate(numeric_cols):\n    plt.subplot(n_rows, n_cols, index+1)\n    \n    sns.kdeplot(train[col], hue=train.song_popularity.astype(\"bool\"), fill=True)\n    plt.title(col, fontsize=14)\n    plt.xlabel(\"\")\n    plt.ylabel(\"\")\n    plt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations:\n\nBy looking at the probability distribution of different variables we find that popular songs are almost exactly the same length as unpopular ones. There is a slight difference, but it’s pretty small.\n\nNow we can check the categorical features.\n\n\nCode\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(18,5))\n\nfor index, col in enumerate([\"key\", \"audio_mode\", \"time_signature\"]):\n    plt.subplot(1,3,index+1)\n    \n    sns.countplot(train[col], hue=train.song_popularity.astype(\"bool\"))\n    plt.title(col, fontsize=14)\n    plt.xlabel(\"\")\n    plt.ylabel(\"\")\n    plt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.

Consequently, energy and loudness share a strong correlation.\nNone of the features individually show a notable correlation with the target song_popularity.\n\n\n\n5.2.2. Categorical feature interactions\nWhenever we’re looking at categorical features, we can assign a visualisation dimension like colour, size, or facets to those. We will start modifying our trusted density plots to look at the distributions of energy (potentially one of the more interesting numerical features) for the different values of time_signature (here encoded as colour):\n\n\nCode\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(10,8))\nsns.kdeplot(x=\"energy\", hue=\"time_signature\", data=train, fill=True, bw=0.03)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n(ggplot(train, aes(\"key\", \"time_signature\", fill = \"energy\")) \n + geom_tile()\n + theme(figure_size=(16,5))\n + scale_x_continuous(breaks=range(0,12)))\n\n\n\n\n\n<ggplot: (8777952485729)>\n\n\nWe find:\n\nFor time_signatures 2 and 5 we have no instances of key == 11. This is no big surprise, since those three values are already rare individually, which makes their combinations even more rare.\nThere are no clear clusters of high vs low energy features here.\nWe can see certain combinations that are particularly low energy, such as key == 2 and time_signature == 1 or 8. key == 3 and time_signature == 1 seems to be a particularly energetic combination.\n\n\n\n\n5.3. Feature Target Interaction\nOnce we have found interesting correlations we can look for clustering in the target variable.\n\n\nCode\n(ggplot(train, aes('key', 'time_signature')) \n + geom_tile(aes(fill='energy')) \n + facet_wrap(\"song_popularity\", nrow = 2) \n + theme_minimal() \n + theme(figure_size=(16, 8))\n + scale_x_continuous(breaks=range(0,12)))\n\n\n\n\n\n<ggplot: (8777950648995)>\n\n\n\n\nCode\nsns.displot(data=train, x=\"energy\", y=\"audio_valence\", col=\"song_popularity\", kind=\"kde\", fill=True, legend=True, height=8, aspect=0.75)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))\nsns.scatterplot(x=\"energy\", y=\"acousticness\", hue=\"song_popularity\", data=train)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Resources:\n\nChoosing different color palette in Seaborn\nSee also\n\nPairGrid: Subplot grid for plotting pairwise relationships\nrelplot: Combine a relational plot and a FacetGrid\ndisplot: Combine a distribution plot and a FacetGrid\ncatplot: Combine a categorical plot and a FacetGrid\nlmplot: Combine a regression plot and a FacetGrid\n\n\nSpecial Thanks to Martin Henze for sharing his knowledge during the live coding session.

    "section": "History of Natural Language Processing",
    "text": "History of Natural Language Processing\nThe dawn of NLP can be dated back to the early 1900s. In 1950, Alan Turing published his famous article “Computing Machinery and Intelligence” which proposed what is now called the Turing test as a criterion of intelligence. It tests the ability of the computer program to impersonate a human in a real-time conversation with a human judge where the judge is unable to distinguish the human from the computer program. In 1954, the Georgetown experiment automatically translated more than sixty Russian words into English.\nIn 1957, Noam Chomsky’s Syntactic Structures a rule-based system of syntactic structures with “universal grammar” was an incredible advancement. Up to the 1980’s most of the NLP systems were based on complex hand-written rules but in the late 1980s by the introduction of machine learning algorithms for language processing revolutionized the field. A steady increase in computational power resulting from Moore’s law and use of statistical models that use probabilistic measures to map the features making up the input data. Watson an artificial intelligence software designed as a question answering system won the Jeopardy contest, defeating the best human players in February 2011.\nDevelopment of famous virtual assistants like Siri in 2011, Amazon Alexa in 2014, and Google Assistant in 2016. The use of deep learning produced better results than the state-of-the-art in many natural language processing tasks, such as machine translation, text classification, and many more. Recent advancements include the use of network architecture of the transformer which is based on the attention mechanism that has produced better results in various NLP tasks.\nWe humans in our daily life overlook the powerful ability of our human brain to read, understand the meaning of a word, it’s context (how does it relate to each other), understand humor, sarcasm, and thousand other things. How do we teach this to a computer?"

    "section": "Challenges",
    "text": "Challenges\n1. Ambiguity:  In a natural language, words are unique but their meaning may differ based on the context in which it is used. One classical example used is: - The bank is a financial institution where customers can save or borrow money. - Tom was sitting by the banks of the river.\nIn this example, we can see that the word “bank” is used in two different ways. The word is the same but the meaning is different. This is because the context in which the word is used is different.\n2. Co-Referencing: It is a process to find all the phrases in the document that refer to the same entity. Example: Harry kept the paneer on the plate and ate it. Here it refers to the paneer that he ate which was kept on the plate.\n3. Information Extraction: Identifying phrases in a language that refer to specific types of entities and relations in text. Named Entity Recognition (NER) is the task used to identify the names of people, organizations, places, etc, in a text. Example: Tom used to work at FedEx and lives in Mumbai, India. where Person = Tom, organization = FedEx and Place = Mumbai, India\n4. Personality, intention, emotions, and style: Different authors may have different personalities, intentions, emotions, and styles to convey the same idea. Based on these factors the underlying idea can be interpreted in different ways. Use of humor or sarcasm may convey a meaning that is opposite of the literal one."

    "section": "Applications",
    "text": "Applications\n1. Machine Translation:  The idea behind machine translation is to develop a system that is capable of translating text from one language to another without any human intervention. Only translating the text from one language to another is not the key. Understanding the meaning behind the text and translating it to some other language is the crux of it. Example: Google Translate\n2. Automatic summarization:  We all love to read storybooks and always a good storybook will have a summary at the end that highlights the important things about the story. Likewise take any piece of text, a story, a news article, etc, and develop a system that can automatically summary the piece of text. Example: Inshorts – an app that summarizes each news article in 60 words.\n3. Sentiment Analysis:  It deals with the study of extracting opinions and sentiment that are not always explicitly expressed. For instance it helps the company to understand the level of consumer satisfaction for its goods and services. Example: “I love the new iPhone and it has a great camera.”.\nAnother branch of sentiment analysis is “Aspect based Sentiment Analysis” where it tries to extract opinions for each aspect from the customer review. Example: “The new iPhone is great it has a great camera but the battery life is not that good.” Here the customer is satisfied with the camera aspect of the iPhone but not the battery life.\n4. Text Classification:  Organizing text documents into predefined categories enables to classify the information or any activity. Examples: Classifying an email as spam or not spam.\n5. Question Answering:  Question answering deals with a system that can answer questions posed by humans in natural language. Sounds simple yet building the knowledge base, understanding the text, and to answer in natural language is altogether a thing in itself.\n6. Chatbots:  Chatbots are a piece of software that can simulate a conversation (or chat) with a user in natural language through websites, apps, messaging applications, etc. Chatbots are a natural evolution of question answering system but are one step further with their ability to understand the text and engage in a conversation.\n7. Speech Recognition:  Using our voice to interact with our phones has become a common phenomenon. For example to ask questions to our voice assistants like Google Assistant/Siri/Cortana, use of voice to type a piece of text. Recognizing speech has replaced the method by which we interact with our devices and made it so convenient.\nRecent advancements in NLP have deepened our knowledge on how to tackle the various challenges in NLP. Also, this new decade will be filled with excitement and breakthroughs that awaits us. Stay tunned to deep dive into the world of NLP.\nShare if you like it, comment if you loved it.
