    "Prefect is an open-source workflow orchestration tool that helps you automate and manage the flow of work across your data stack. \n",
    "\n",
    "Prefect is built on Python and uses a modular architecture that makes it easy to build and deploy complex workflows.  Prefect also includes a rich set of features for monitoring, debugging, and managing your workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into Prefect, let's first understand what is workflow orchestration, why do we need it, and where does Prefect come into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Workflow Orchestration?\n",
    "\n",
    "Building a ML system has a lot of moving parts. We have to deal with data collection, data preprocessing, model training, model serving, etc. Each of these steps can be further broken down into sub-steps. For example, data preprocessing can be broken down into feature engineering, feature selection, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Workflow Orchestration is the process of automating and managing the flow of work across these steps. It helps us build complex workflows by combining multiple steps together. It also helps us manage the dependencies between these steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../images/introduction-workflow-orchestration/workflow.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Negative Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "Inspite of building a robust system, there are chances that something might go wrong. For example, the data might not be available, the model might fail to train, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](../images/introduction-workflow-orchestration/workflow_failed.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Often time while developing any application, we find ourselves spending a lot of time fixing bugs and making sure that everything works as expected. We spend time writing code to handle edge cases and make sure that our application is robust enough to handle any unexpected situation. Exmaples of such situations are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Writing Retries logic when APIs go down\n",
    "- Build Notifications for when a job fails\n",
    "- Record logs for observability and debugging\n",
    "- Write conditional logic to handle edge cases\n",
    "- Handle cases when requests timeouts or fails\n",
    "\n",
    "Negative Engineering refers to ideology that we spend most of our time writing code to handle edge cases rather than writing code that actually solves the problem. This is where Workflow Orchestration comes into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "Worflow Orchestration tools provide set of features off the shelf that aim to eliminate the need for negative engineering. These tools provide features like retries, notifications, logging, lineage tracking, etc. out of the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prefect\n",
    "\n",
    "Prefect aims to eliminate the need for negative engineering by providing a rich set of features out of the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a good practice to create a virtual environment for each project. This helps us keep our dependencies separate and avoid any version conflicts.\n",

    "\n",
    "We will be using the [NYC Taxi Dataset](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page) for this tutorial. The dataset contains information about green taxi trips in New York City. The dataset is available in parquet format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps that we'll cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We'll download the dataset from the NY Taxi website and load it into a pandas dataframe.\n",
    "2. Preprocess the data.\n",
    "3. Train a model on the preprocessed data.\n",
    "4. Log the model and the metrics to MLflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll wonder where do we use Prefect in this? Answer is in each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll go through each step in detail. At the end you'll find the complete code for the workflow.\n"

To prepare a delicious sandwich you need to perform a few tasks like: get the bread, apply butter, add cheese, cut down the veggies, etc. Each of these tasks is a unit of work that needs to be done to prepare the sandwich.

    "\n",
    "It hashes all inputs to the task and returns a unique hash. If the task inputs do not change, the hash will remain the same and the cachec results are used instead of running the task again until cache expires.\n",
