    "In this post, we'll cover how to deploy your machine learning / deep learning models on HuggingFace Spaces with Gradio.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by creating a simple gradio app to understand how it works. Then we'll deploy our model on HuggingFace Spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Gradio?\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradio is a Python library that allows you to quickly create customizable UI components around your machine learning models. It's a great way to share your models with others and get feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are familiar with Streamlit, Gradio is similar to that. You can install it using pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install gradio\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating a Gradio App\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a simple Gradio app to understand how it works. You can create your app in a Jupyter notebook or a Python script. I'll be using a Jupyter notebook to showcase various features of Gradio. \n",
    "\n",
    "Later compile the notebook to a Python script to run the app.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by importing the necessary libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import gradio as gr\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use only if you are using a Jupyter notebook\n",
    "%load_ext gradio\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Components\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradio provides various pre-built components that you can use to create your app. Let's look at some of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Markdown**: The markdown component allows you to display text in your app. \n",
    "- **Textbox**: The textbox component allows you to take input from the user in the form of text. \n",
    "- **Slider**: The slider component allows you to take input from the user in the form of a number.\n",
    "- **Dropdown**: The dropdown component allows you to take input from the user in the form of a list of options. Allows you to select one options.\n",
    "- **Radio**: The radio component allows you to take input from the user in the form of a list of options. Allows you to select only one option.\n",
    "- **Checkbox**: The checkbox component allows you to take input from the user in the form of a boolean value.\n",
    "- **CheckboxGroup**: The checkbox group component allows you to take input from the user in the form of a list of options. Allows you to select one/multiple options.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find the complete list of components [here](https://gradio.app/docs/#components).\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example of how to use these components."

    "```\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's understand the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we define a function `sentence_generator` that takes in the inputs and returns a sentence. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then we define the components that we want to use in our app. We define a slider, a dropdown, a radio, a checkbox group, a dropdown with multiselect, and a checkbox. We also define the default values for each component.\n",
    "\n",
    "We declared variables for each component so that we can use the value of the component later in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradio has two ways to create a web-based UI:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Interface\n",
    "2. Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "Interface is high-level class, enables building web-based GUI in a few lines of code. You must specify three parameters: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The function to create a GUI for \n",
    "2. The desired input components and\n",
    "3. The desired output components. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additional parameters can be used to control the appearance and behavior of the demo.\n",
    "\n",
    "More on blocks later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuing with our code, we define the interface. We pass in the function, the inputs, the outputs, and the examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "You'll notice the interface automatically created `Clear`, `Submit` and `Flag` buttons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the inputs are the variables that we defined earlier based on the components. The outputs is the type of output that we want to display. In our case, it's text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples are great way to showcase some one-click examples that the user can try out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we launch the app. I encourage you to play with the app and try out different combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "Blocks are low-level components that can be used to build a web-based GUI. They provide more flexibility and control than the interface class over:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The layout of components\n",
    "2. The events that trigger the execution of functions\n",
    "3. Data flows (e.g. inputs can trigger outputs, which can trigger the next level of outputs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Blocks also offers ways to group together related demos such as with tabs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic usage of Blocks is as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a Blocks object, then use it as a context (with the \"with\" statement), and\n",
    "- Define layouts, components, or events within the Blocks context. \n",
    "- Finally, call the launch() method to launch the demo.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Block Layouts\n",
    "\n",
    "Layouts are used to organize components in a Blocks object. There are various layouts available: `Row`, `Column`, `Tab`, `Group`, `Box`, and `Accordion`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll go through some layout examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Row\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Row` layout places components in a row i.e. horizontally."
