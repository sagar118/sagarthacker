    "\n",
    "To follow along with this post, you'll need the [AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) version 2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html). To check if you have AWS CLI installed, run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "aws --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create an IAM role\n",
    "\n",
    "Create an IAM role that you can use to access AWS services and resources. Follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the [roles page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/roles) in the IAM console.\n",
    "2. Click on **Create role**.\n",
    "3. Give the role the following properties:\n",
    "    - **Trusted entity**: AWS service\n",
    "    - **Use case**: Lambda\n",
    "    - **Permissions**: AWSLambdaKinesisExecutionRole\n",
    "    - **Role name**: `lamdba-kinesis-role`\n",
    "\n",
    "The **AWSLambdaKinesisExecutionRole** policy has the permissions that the function needs to read items from Kinesis and write logs to CloudWatch Logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create a Lambda function\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll create a Lambda function that reads records from a Kinesis stream and writes them to CloudWatch Logs. Follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open the [Lambda console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/) in the AWS Management Console.\n",
    "2. Choose **Create function**.\n",
    "3. Give the function the following properties:\n",
    "    - Select **Author from scratch**.\n",
    "    - **Function name**: `ride-duration-prediction-test`\n",
    "    - **Runtime**: Python 3.9\n",
    "    - **Permissions**: Toggle the `Change default execution role` and select `Use an existing role`. Choose the `lamdba-kinesis-role` role that you created earlier.\n",
    "4. Choose **Create function**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the function is created, you'll see code editor with a file name `lambda_function.py` created for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the file you might have noticed the `lambda_handler` function. The handler function is the entry point for Lambda functions. It's the python function that get's executed when the Lambda function is invoked. \n",
    "\n",
    "The handler function always takes two arguments: `event` and `context`. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Event\n",
    "\n",
    "The `event` argument is the data that's passed to the function when it's invoked. For example, if the lambda function is invoked by an HTTP request, the `event` argument will contain information about the HTTP request. \n",
    "\n",
    "Think of the `event` argument as the input to the function, the function then processes the input based on some logic and may or may not return an output. The functions can be triggered by different events such as an HTTP request, a message in a queue, a file upload to S3, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context\n",
    "\n",
    "The `context` argument provides information about the function and the execution environment. For example, the `context` argument contains the name of the function, the function version, the execution time, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "`context` is a Python object that implements methods and has properties that you can use to get information about the function and the execution environment. For example, you can use the `context.get_remaining_time_in_millis()` method to get the remaining execution time for the function in milliseconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's add some code to the `lambda_handler` function to log the `event` and `context` arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import json\n",
    "\n",
    "def lambda_handler(event, context):\n",

    "    return {\n",
    "        'statusCode': 200,\n",
    "        'body': json.dumps('Hello from Lambda!')\n",
    "    }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "::: {.callout-note}\n",
    "Everytime you make changes to the Lambda function, you need to deploy the changes. You can deploy the changes by clicking on the **Deploy** button in the top right corner of the Lambda console.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "To test the function, click on the **Test** button and create a new test event. Give the test event a name, for example `test-event`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll notice there is a drop down for the event template. For now we'll use the default `hello-world` template, however I encourage you to explore the other templates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Click on the **Save** button and then click on the **Test** button again.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create a Kinesis stream\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a Kinesis stream that you can use to send data to the Lambda function. Follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open the [Kinesis console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/kinesis) in the AWS Management Console.\n",
    "2. Choose **Kinesis Data Streams** and then choose **Create data stream**.\n",

    "    - **Stream name**: `ride-event`\n",
    "    - **Capacity mode**: Provisioned\n",
    "    - **Provisioned shards**: 1\n",
    "4. Choose **Create data stream**.\n",

    "## Add a trigger to the Lambda function\n",
    "\n",
    "A trigger is a configurable resource that enables an AWS service to invoke your function in response to specific events or conditions.\n",
    "Your function can be associated with multiple triggers, allowing it to respond to various event-driven scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add a trigger to the Lambda function that we created earlier. Follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Navigate back to the `ride-duration-prediction-test` Lambda function in the Lambda console.\n",
    "2. In the **Function overview** section, choose **Add trigger** button.\n",
    "3. Choose **Kinesis** from the list of triggers.\n",
    "4. Give the trigger the following properties:\n",

    "The credentials are used to authenticate the user when they interact with AWS. \n",
    "\n",
    "The IAM policy defines the permissions that the user has to access AWS services and resources. We attach the policy to the user to grant the user permissions to access AWS services and resources.\n",

    "## Review what we have done so far [Optional]\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll divide the review into three parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 1: Create a Lambda function and a Kinesis stream\n",
    "\n",
    "- We created a Lambda function and explained how it works.\n",
    "- We also tried to modify the Lambda function and tested it.\n",
    "- We created a Kinesis stream that will receive the data.\n",
    "- We added a Kinesis trigger to the Lambda function, so that the Lambda function is invoked when data is sent to the Kinesis stream.\n",
    "- However, the Lambda function doesn't have the permission to read from the Kinesis stream. So, we added the `AWSLambdaKinesisExecutionRole` permission to the `lambda-kinesis-role` role.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2: Send data to the Kinesis stream\n",
    "\n",
    "- To test what we have done in part 1, we sent some data to the Kinesis stream.\n",
    "- Since, we are performing this action from our local machine, we need to have the AWS CLI installed and configured.\n",
    "- For a individual (user) to interact with the AWS resources, we created an IAM user. However, what are the permissions that we gave to the IAM user? We gave the permissions to send data to the Kinesis stream. We did this by attaching the `kinesis-write-policy` policy to the IAM user, allowing the user to write on `ride-event` Kinesis stream.\n",
    "- Similar to how we use API key to authenticate ourselves to a service, we used the `access key` and `secret key` of the IAM user to authenticate ourselves to AWS.\n",
    "- Lastly, we used the AWS CLI to send data to the Kinesis stream and view the logs in CloudWatch Logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 3: Send the prediction to another Kinesis stream\n",
    "\n",
    "- We created another Kinesis stream called `ride-prediction` which will receive the prediction from the Lambda function.\n",
    "- However, does the Lambda function have the permission to write to the Kinesis stream? No, it doesn't. So, we created a policy called `kinesis-write-policy-prediction` that allows the Lambda function to write to the Kinesis stream. \n",
    "- We attached this policy to the `lambda-kinesis-role` role.\n",
    "- We'll now update the Lambda function to send the prediction to the Kinesis stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Update the Lambda function to send the prediction to the Kinesis stream\n",
